<h2>Food Bank</h2>
<p>
  The Food Bank started as a pop-up location in 2020 due to COVID-19. We used
  our gymnasium to sort food and build the food hampers. Refrigeration was in
  short supply. Deliveries happened in the morning with one set of volunteers,
  and hampers built at moment of distribution by another set of volunteers. We
  had to modify our delivery service over a dozen times, contending with various
  issues such as heat, long line ups, and language barriers.
